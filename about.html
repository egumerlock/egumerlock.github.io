      <h3><span>Bio</span></h3>
      <p class="tab">Eric Gumerlock was originally raised in Switzerland, and moved to the Bay Area for high school.  After graduating from UCLA, he began his professional life as a research analyst at CSS, a trading firm in Chicago.  After moving back to the Bay Area, he decided to make a career shift into something that required both technical skills and design; web development.
      </p>
      <p class="tab">Aside from coding, Eric also enjoys playing basketball, hiking trails, traveling, and producing music.  Since childhood he has played guitar and has continued in his passion for music by producing his own songs in his free time.  He attended Berklee School of Music for guitar and sound design for a few semesters before making the switch to coding, so great design is in his blood!
      </p>
      <p class="tab">Eric loves spicy foods, has two bearded dragons, and loves spending time on the beach or in nature.  He also has a BS in Environmental Science from UCLA, and is very passionate about the environment.
