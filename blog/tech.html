    What is Rails?<br>
    <br>
    Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language  created by David Heinemeier Hansson.  He was first programming on PHP, but was quickly frustrated by a lack of abstraction and repetitive code.  He tried Ruby, and enjoyed its ease of use.  Ruby is one of the most streamlined languages, with less code required to create basic data structures, and it is a modern language that allows high-levels of abstractions. One of the key advantages of Ruby is RubyGems, a package manager that easily can great and share software libraries or gems, that extend Ruby.  RubyGems provides a simple system to install gems on, making open-source software extremely easy to implement within your own Ruby framework.<br>
    Some of the disadvantages of Ruby include a slow processing time relative to C++ or Java, although it is usually sufficient for the level of performance required for most websites.  However, for websites with lots of simultaneous activity, it is not the ideal language.  Because Ruby lacks “parallelism” or ability to do many things at once, it is best served for simpler software, such as websites.<br>
    Rails is both popular and widely used, partially because its conventions are easy to pick up.  Any web-application that requires basic functions like generating HTML, form submissions, or accessing a database, and all done very easily with Rails.  It gives the developer a framework on which to build, instead of requiring the gigantic task of creating an infrastructure.  When Heinemeier Hansson and his team created the Rails framework, they were autocratic in their approach, and decided that there is one best way to implement much of the infrastructure required by a web application.  In this respect, it is much easier for a Rails developer to unravel another developer’s work, because they were all built in a similar fashion.  This means collaboration is easier, development is quicker, and theres a large amount of open source code to incorporate.<br>
    When Rails was released in 2004, PHP was a dominant language used by webmasters.  However, the design decisions that went into the first version of Rails garnered a close circle of developers that led to fast growth of Rails use.  It stresses “convention over configuration.”  Because it is adopted by software engineers who were considered influencers and trend setters, often people say that Rails is for the “cool kids.”<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Rails Guiding Principles</strong><br>
    <br>
    Rails is Opinionated<br><br>
    While many other languages are famous for having more than one way to do it, and having no right way, rails is the opposite.  Rails has a best way to solve problems, and in these fewer decisions, you will be able to implement faster development and collaborate easier.<br>

    “Convention over Configuration”<br><br>
    This is a principle that focuses on productivity over being able to configure the inner workings of your site.  You will spend less time thinking about where things go and what names to assign them.<br>

    Don’t Repeat Yourself<br><br>
    DRY is a principle of software development formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas.  Code reuse is at the core of this principle, and again it allows you to eliminate unnecessary code, and get to the actual creation.<br>

    Rails is Omakase<br><br>
    Omakase is a phrase in Japanese that means “I’ll leave it to you.”  At a Japanese restaurant, you can order omakase, entrusting the chef to make a pleasing selection.  Hanson was famous for saying Rails is Omakase, the idea being that his team of “chefs” picked out the best ingredients, designed APIs, according to their ideas of the best full-stack framework.  While they may not match your tastes exactly, they have been thoroughly thought through and are well-formed.<br>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was interesting the input we both had about wireframes, and why we put elements of a page in the positions that we do.  Our wireframe was largely created on my computer using Keynote, which made it more difficult for Jon to directly input his vision, yet everything he said we tried to incorporate.  The HTML was fairly straightforward, we both wrote an HTML file and then shared at the end to see if we got the same result.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I find wireframing to be helpful, yet I can't help but think that the design and the placement go hand in hand.  Depending on the design, I think different elements will look out-of-place.  I think its great to create a plan, however, and in that respect, make sure you have a solid HTML base to begin writing the code to your page.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A good wireframe contains Navigation elements that never let you get "stuck" within a webpage, and also give you the ability to go however far back you so desire in your surfing of the site.  Also, a fuller looking webpage is nice, yet it cant have too many elements to overwhelm the user.  By creating different nav elements, we made a fuller looking page without cluttering up the space too much, just filling it up to a nice level.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about the aside element today, which is a great function for a side nav bar.  It keeps the code tidy and also mentally is an element which will sit to the side.
