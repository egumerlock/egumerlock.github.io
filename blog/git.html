      <p>
        The benefits of version control are many.  Firstly, you know exactly where you are in the development of your app. Secondly, you are able to collaborate much easier with other developers on your team while using a system such as git to track the history of changes made to your app.  Thirdly, you are able to protect your master code from bugs while leaving space for a developer to be creative on a branch of code, and later merging that code.
      </p>
      <p>
          Git helps you keep track of changes by committing at certain points in your web development.  These save points, called commits, allow you to save the work you have done, and push that work up to GitHub if you so desire.  These commits are available to view on GitHub in chronological-order, and each of these commits contains the changes made to files and code.

      <p>
          Why use GitHub? Well, GitHub supplies a remote repository for all of your code.  It is shared among the community of developers (if you so desire) and others are allowed to help you.  It protects you from local destruction of your code (losing your computer), as well as gives you a framework in which you are able to easily track changes to your code, and receive peer review on your changes.  GitHub is free, and streamlined so that it is open for anyone to use.
