    Ruby Hashes vs Javascript Objects

    Although they might look extremely similar, Ruby and Javascript have noticeable syntax differences, especially when it comes to nitpicky notation such as the “;” that is necessary at the end of Javascript statements.  While there a number of differences in Ruby and JS, I am focusing on explaining the difference between the Ruby hash and the JS Object.  Lets start off with the similarities, as they do roughly the same thing - handle composite data structures that can include many different kinds of information (strings, classes, symbols, arrays, other hashes, etc.  They look alike given by their literal notations:
    <pre><code>
      # Ruby hash:
      book = {
        name: “A Wrinkle in Time”,
        year: 1963,
        length: 500,
        publisher: “Farrar, Straus & Giroux”
      }
      // JS object:
        var book = {
        name: “A Wrinkle in Time”,
        year: 1963,
        length: 500,
        publisher: “Farrar, Straus & Giroux”
      };
  </code></pre>
    Nearly the same! Aside from a few more details required in the JS Object.  Accessing their values is also similar, but actually has quite different syntax.
    <pre><code>
      # Ruby hash:
      book[:year]
      => 1963
      // JS object:
      book.year;
      => 1963
    </pre></code>
    Very similar so far, as both consist of a property and a value for that property.  However, the assigner is referred to as a key, whereas in JS it is called a property, but in the end they both find the same value.  The difference here is that in Ruby, keys can be any data type (symbols, strings, etc), but in JS the properties are simply standardized as that: properties of the object that can be called upon by their relative methods.
    Yet, the similarities keep popping up - both in Ruby hashes and JS objects the values can be nearly any data type (arrays, hashes, strings, numbers, booleans).  One major difference is that properties in JS can be functions, whereas Ruby hash values cannot be the Ruby equivalent, methods.  This is definitely an advantage for Javascript, but this doesn’t make Ruby lesser at all.  We would code this into JS like so:
    <pre><code>
    // JS Object
      book.read = function() {
        console.log(“You are about to read” + book.name)
         } ;
      book.read();
  </pre></code>
  You can see in this example that book.name is referred to in the printing statement quite easily.  Also, this entire function is saved as a property in the book object.  As Ruby cannot save a method as a value, you would have to create the method as a separate entity from the hash.
  <pre><code>
    # Ruby
    def read(book)
      puts “You are about to read #{book[:name]}”
    end

    read(book)
  </pre></code>
  This code is disconnected from the hash altogether, and also the reference to book[:name] value is quite a bit harder to type that the one in JS.  This is fixed in Ruby with classes, which gives the ability to reach values in a similar fashion to the one in JS.  For quick and simple references to property values, I think JS wins on this one.

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was interesting the input we both had about wireframes, and why we put elements of a page in the positions that we do.  Our wireframe was largely created on my computer using Keynote, which made it more difficult for Jon to directly input his vision, yet everything he said we tried to incorporate.  The HTML was fairly straightforward, we both wrote an HTML file and then shared at the end to see if we got the same result.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I find wireframing to be helpful, yet I can't help but think that the design and the placement go hand in hand.  Depending on the design, I think different elements will look out-of-place.  I think its great to create a plan, however, and in that respect, make sure you have a solid HTML base to begin writing the code to your page.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A good wireframe contains Navigation elements that never let you get "stuck" within a webpage, and also give you the ability to go however far back you so desire in your surfing of the site.  Also, a fuller looking webpage is nice, yet it cant have too many elements to overwhelm the user.  By creating different nav elements, we made a fuller looking page without cluttering up the space too much, just filling it up to a nice level.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about the aside element today, which is a great function for a side nav bar.  It keeps the code tidy and also mentally is an element which will sit to the side.
