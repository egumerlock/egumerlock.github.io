<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was interesting the input we both had about wireframes, and why we put elements of a page in the positions that we do.  Our wireframe was largely created on my computer using Keynote, which made it more difficult for Jon to directly input his vision, yet everything he said we tried to incorporate.  The HTML was fairly straightforward, we both wrote an HTML file and then shared at the end to see if we got the same result.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I find wireframing to be helpful, yet I can't help but think that the design and the placement go hand in hand.  Depending on the design, I think different elements will look out-of-place.  I think its great to create a plan, however, and in that respect, make sure you have a solid HTML base to begin writing the code to your page.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A good wireframe contains Navigation elements that never let you get "stuck" within a webpage, and also give you the ability to go however far back you so desire in your surfing of the site.  Also, a fuller looking webpage is nice, yet it cant have too many elements to overwhelm the user.  By creating different nav elements, we made a fuller looking page without cluttering up the space too much, just filling it up to a nice level.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about the aside element today, which is a great function for a side nav bar.  It keeps the code tidy and also mentally is an element which will sit to the side.
